<h1>Sensitivity Analyses and Value of Information</h1>
<p>Models are used to inform decision making and resource allocation in health care, therefore, it is important that they report point estimates for specific outcomes as well as the uncertainty surrounding these outcomes. Modellers can perform sensitivity analyses (deterministic (DSA) or probabilistic (PSA)) to report on the uncertainty of their modelsâ€™ outcomes, or value of information analysis (VOI) to assess the expected gain from reducing uncertainty through some form of data collection (trial, epidemiological study, etc.). More information on parameter estimation, uncertainty, sensitivity anlyses, VOIs can be found in the following publications:</p>
