<div id="what-does-this-package-do" class="section level2">
<h2>What does this package do?</h2>
<p>This package is useful for running probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA). Note that this package does not produce or run a base-analysis model, it is useful for post-processing the output (e.g. plotting PSA results.</p>
<p>Other functionality was not explored as part of this exercise.</p>

<h2>How do I input my data to it/what inputs does it take?</h2>

<pre class="bcea"><code>bcea(e, c, ref = 1, interventions = NULL, Kmax = 50000, wtp = NULL, plot = FALSE)
where is states
e An object containing nsim simulations for the variable of clinical effectiveness for each intervention being considered. In general it is a matrix with nsim rows and nint columns.
c An object containing nsim simulations for the variable of cost for each intervention being considered. In general it is a matrix with nsim rows and nint columns.
        # effectiveness and cost
          ref=2, # selects the 2nd row of (e,c)
        # as containing the reference intervention
          interventions=treats, # defines the labels to be associated
        # with each intervention
          Kmax=50000, # maximum value possible for the willingness
        # to pay threshold; implies that k is chosen
        # in a grid from the interval (0,Kmax)
          plot=TRUE # plots the results

-          The main use for “standard” models is for PSA plots &amp; analysis of PSA results where e and c rows represent the expected outcomes and costs from your PSA model runs e.g.

-          [1,] [E(QALY) PSA outpu1] [E(QALY) PSA output 1]
-          [2,] [PSA output2] [PSA output 2]
-       c
-         Status Quo Vaccination
-          [1,] [E(cost) PSA outpu1] [E(cost)PSA output 1]
