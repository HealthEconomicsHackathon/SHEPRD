# Dynamic Transmission Models

## Introduction:
Dynamic models are for communicable diseases. Unlike the assumption of static models where infection risk is constant, dynamic models key feature is that this infection risk parameter is variable. These models can be deterministic or stochastic, individual or cohort based.

## When might I use this?
The key feature of these models is that infectious risk varies throughout the time of modelling with the number of infectious agents present. 
Indirect effects are accounted for by these models eg. herd immunity due to mass vaccination
These models are useful for examining interventions and their impact on pathogen ecology/life cycle and also exploring an interventionâ€™s impact on transmission. This can either be through:
-decreasing susceptible proportion of the population eg. vaccination
-decreasing contact between individuals eg. isolation measures
- measures to reduce duration of infectious period  eg. drug interventions
-measures to reduce transmissability eg. drug interventions
Common examples for these models are measuring impact of a vaccine in a population, use of antivirals or biosecurity/isolation measures in disease outbreaks.
E.g Assessing the potential malaria risk to the UK (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2845590/)
