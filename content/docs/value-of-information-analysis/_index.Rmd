## Introduction
VOI is a quantitative, systematic method to assess decision uncertainty and evaluate existing evidence to determine if new technology/interventions will provide a return on investment.

## Why & when Might I use one?
VOI can be used in several scenarios and is becoming an increasingly utilised tool.
Eg. Funders examining a range of projects can rank the return expected from each and make funding choices from this
Eg. As an alternative to traditional methods such as power calculations to determine study sample size
Eg. Perform an economic evaluation of the next steps in a project.

SAVI - Sheffield Accelerated Value of Information
SAVI can be used to evaluate uncertainty in a standardised manner (C-E (cost-effectiveness)planes, cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs), as well as assess the expected value of perfect information (EVPI) and expected value of perfect parameter information (EVPPI)
