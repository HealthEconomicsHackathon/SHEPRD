# Signposting Health Economic Packages in R for Decision Modelling

This webpage aims to help you navigate you through the forest of R packages and signpost you to the most appropriate one, given your intended health economic analysis. This decision tree-style compendium was created over 2 days as part of a R Hackathon (6th - 7th November 2019), with work continued until 2020. Last updated April 2020.

Creators and current contributors are:
[@nichola_naylor](https://twitter.com/nichola_naylor), 
[@collepto1](https://twitter.com/collepto1), [@kd_katdavis](https://twitter.com/kd_katdavis), Arthi Roopan, 
 ,[@alexhillphd](https://twitter.com/alexhillphd),[@RositsaKolarova](https://twitter.com/rositsakolarova), and    Monique Tan
 
By clicking on the various model subheadings, information about R packages and code available will be displayed.
This is not exhaustive but covers some of the key packages and coding literature in relation to health economic evaluation models.
