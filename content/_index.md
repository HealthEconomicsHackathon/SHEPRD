# Signposting Health Economic Packages in R for Decision Modelling

<div id="tree"></div>

This webpage aims to help you navigate you through the forest of R packages and 
signpost you to the most appropriate one, given your intended health economic analysis. 
This decision tree-style compendium was written over 2 days as part of a R Hackathon 
(6th - 7th November 2019).
